# Ceasar-Cipher
A function which carries out a Ceasar Cipher, including encryption and decryption.
<br/>
Multiple viable Ceaser Cipher functions are included, though the most potable option is at the end of the code.
# Usage
Run the following command through terminal:
<br/>
```
py Ceasar-Cipher.py
```
Enter any of the three options, which are:
```
a | Encrypt</li>
b | Decrypt - with a shift </li>
c | Decrypt - without a shift </li>
```
Please note: The code an be altered to run different included functions, though by default it will run the most efficient and featured function.
# Features
<ul>
  <li>Encryption</li>
  <li>Decryption</li>
  <li>Includes the option to decrypt without a shift (key) - Explained further below</li>
  <li>Allows you to include your own alphabet for the program to use to encrypt/decrypt with</li>
</ul>
<p>
The decryption (without a shift/key) option is a less efficient option than decryption (with a shift/key) as it will run through every possible shift, and only select the resulting decrypted text which has one of its words in the english dictionary to display, though if no valid word is found, it will display all of the possible decrypted versions of the text, along with their corresponding shifts, and therefore it is slower and less efficient than the option with a key, but all the more powerful.
